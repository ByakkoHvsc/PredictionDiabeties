#### Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning


This project investigates the use of machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. We will focus on employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to analyze health data and identify those at risk.


## How it Works:


- Data Gathering: We'll collect a dataset containing various health measurements and corresponding information on whether someone has diabetes.
- Data Preparation: The data will be cleaned, formatted, and potentially adjusted to ensure the model can understand it effectively.
- Training and Testing: The data will be split into two parts. The first part will train the model, allowing it to learn the patterns that differentiate between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals based on their health readings. The second part will be used to test the model's accuracy.

- Building the Model: An SVM algorithm will be used to create a model that can classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their health information.

- Evaluation: We'll assess how well the model performs by comparing its predictions on the testing data to the actual labels.

- Prediction: Once satisfied with the model's performance, we can use it to predict the likelihood of diabetes for new individuals based on their health readings.
